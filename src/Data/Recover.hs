-- | A @Recover e v@ contains a value @v@ or an error @e@ or both. This is
-- similar to `Data.These`, but with a different `Applicative` instance.
--
-- Like `Data.Validation`, the `Applicative` instance of `Recover` enables the
-- of validating various values while accumulating all the errors.

-- > Foo <$> (Success a) <*> (Success b) == Success (Foo a b)
-- > Foo <$> (Failure e) <*> (Failure ee) == Failure (e <> ee)
-- > Foo <$> (Success a) <*> (Failure ee) == Failure e
--
-- Unlike `Data.Validation`, `Recover` also has a constructor that represents
-- the situation in which there were errors but a value could be nonetheless
-- obtained. All errors are still accumulated.
